/**
 * Created by Gabriel on 2017-10-31.
 * Use to implement a 0, 1, 2, ..., (maxToggle-1), 0, 1, 2, ... toggle that toggles (increments or revert to 0) when a button is pressed
 * An example of when you might want to use this is when you have multiple motors that you might want the same button to control.
 * Use a switch in your code and for each value of the toggle, set a different motor to be used.
